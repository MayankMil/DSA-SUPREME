PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE -> C++

HELLO WORLD.CPP

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {

  cout << "Hello_World!" << endl;

  return 0;

}

----------------------------------------
#include is used to add header files in the code.
<iostream> is the specific header file that enables the use of cout and cin in our code.
using namespace std is used to avoid collisions and allows us to use cout directly without specifying the namespace.
int is the return type for the main function.
main() is the starting point of a C++ program and must be present in every code.
The opening curly brace { marks the start of the scope of the main function.
cout is used to print something on the screen.
<< is the insertion operator used to send literals to the output device.
"Hello, world!" is a string literal that will be printed.
endl is used to add a new line after printing.
return 0 is used to indicate that the program executed successfully.
The closing curly brace } terminates the scope of the main function.

TAKING INPUT IN C++

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {

  int age; cin >> age;
  cout << age << endl;

  return 0;
}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The code includes the <iostream> header file, which provides input and output stream functionality.

The using namespace std; line allows you to use names from the std namespace without explicitly qualifying them. In this case, it enables you to use cin and cout without writing std::cin and std::cout.

The int main() function is the entry point of the program. It is where the execution of the program begins.

Inside the main() function, there is a variable declaration int age; which declares an integer variable called age. This variable will be used to store the age of the person.

The cin >> age; statement is used to read the input from the user and store it in the age variable. The >> operator is the input stream extraction operator, and it extracts the input from the user and assigns it to the variable.

The cout << age << endl; statement prints the value of age to the standard output (console). The << operator is the output stream insertion operator, and it is used to insert the value of age into the output stream. The endl manipulator is used to insert a new line after printing the value of age, making the output appear on a new line.

The return 0; statement indicates the end of the main() function and the successful termination of the program. The value 0 is returned to the operating system, indicating that the program executed without any errors.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
int age = 25; // Declaration and initialization of 'age' with the value 25
double weight = 68.5; // Declaration and initialization of 'weight' with the value 68.5
char grade = 'A'; // Declaration and initialization of 'grade' with the character 'A'
bool isStudent = true; // Declaration and initialization of 'isStudent' with the value 'true'
